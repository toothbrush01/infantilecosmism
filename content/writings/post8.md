There is a school of people - known as the "web minimalists" - who believe the web needs to revturn to tradition or something. Minimal CSS, no JavaScript, and the usage of web safe fonts. While we here at infantilecosmism dot net believe in the speed and lightness advantages of web minimalism - we might add that the way content is laid out has profoundly changed.

Back in the good ol days - when backgrounds were beige and RSS feeds the rage - monitors had a different aspect ratio. They were squares. No need to fuck with any margins or center any text as the monitor was simply small enough to write raw HTML. With the move to widescreen monitors however margins are infact necessary to ensure the text isn't overwide. A basic CSS layout is necessary if you don't want a site that's the typographic equvilant of shit.

*In my humble opinion* Wikipedia and most blogs should immediately switch to the new margin standard and perhaps browsers could enforce it by force. No longer should humanity cope with reading a line of text that takes up a whole computer screen - anyone who does that is a warcriminal imo.
