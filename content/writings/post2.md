Lonely nights, dark days, bright dawns – my mind had been wrapped in delirium for a decade. Locked at home as a child, now locked as a corporate wage slave for Meta. A vast Kowloon esque fortress arose time and time for my parents – recycled plastics stacked higher than Babel. There are no offices here – an expensive and frankly boring pursuit – instead dormitories stacked to the sky. A metal bed with a “space-saving” air mattress that forms into a couch on a tap. There are no lights – just a glass that comes from the sky at night. Food is tubed in through IV wires routed throughout the premise. I never dared to show my parents this place – every time they came, I would always disappear to them – only meeting them on the metaverse.

In AD 2025, the Chinese Republic invaded Taiwan. Society changed then. Of course we were not normal – most of us were aliened antisocial celibates. An unresponsive sclerotic government suddenly revealed the panticpon underneath us. Slowly but surely people were offered jobs too good to be true at Meta – with generous pay and health insurance packages. They disappeared into vast Pokemkin villages in Utah. In a naturally Foucauldian manner, the government didn’t dispense with potential antiwar sympathizers through violence – no, no – they were stripped away of their ability to be human. Work didn’t happen in an office despite them being relocated. Work was now “fun, enjoyable, spiritually satisfying” as it mostly involved games. What type of games…

I was dropped into a 3D reconstruction of Tianjin. Angelic representations surrounded me. The game was simple – find the X. The government had been aware of a new Chinese material being developed here as the war effort slowly moved along. But they didn’t know much else due to the increasingly paranoid and secretive stance of the Chinese government. I was to find any researcher I could and dig into their lives – the geography of their lives and narrow down suspects. Intelligence could now be done completely remotely as Starlink internet satellites created detailed 3D maps of the whole Earth. US cyberattacks had broken massive Tencent, ByteDance, and Alibaba databases to create a detailed collection of the citizens of the People’s Republic.  Of course, a human was necessary to process this stream of garbage. 

Walking along a vast highway I surveilled inside the cars. Wang Hui – 21, student, drunkard. Shi Yu – 55, bureaucrat, ACCESS RESTRICTED. Qin Hu – 43, livestreamer. He caught my eye. I decided to check his schedule. Apparently while the vast majority of his day was taken by livestreaming there was a suspicious 5-hour gap in the middle of the day where he went to one of the major universities around here. A livestreamer, at 43?? What did he livestream about anyways?

Ah well, patriotic humdrum. The war effort is completing the anti-poverty drive, Pony Ma was an American comprador, Chinese planes in LA… not to different from our own news. Something about him irked me. His content was off in a way. Suddenly I lost control of myself – red sirens started blaring. The ground started shacking underneath me and the buildings started falling down. I couldn’t escape, I couldn’t….





CYBERATTACK REPORT
Thielgrad, Utah

Chinese cyberattack reported at Section B Building 56 Apartment 789 of the H Housing District. Subject was researching Chinese livestreamer before a Chinese hacker gained access to the system and caused a fatal seizure in the subject. As the lowest level of “intelligence synthesizer” and due to the absolute irrelevance of the intelligence further action will not be pursued on this matter.
