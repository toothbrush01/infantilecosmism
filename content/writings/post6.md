In Marxist circles much is discussed - little of substance. The insanity of neoliberalism capitalism or genuine insight is rarely revealed - the aim of course is to convert one to a standard boilerplate ideology. In fact the whole ontology of political discourse presupposes that ideologies exist as commodified products: a mind gene to be implanted into someone.

Is this not the general state of late stage capitalism as a whole? The uniqueness of a person, their deeper experiences and individual circumstances are not given the mechanism to be adequately expressed. Vast capitalist enterprises churn out products of consumption - segmenting population groups and asymptomatically grouping those at the edge. Labels are provided to diagnose ones deviance in the DSM manual. In a similar fashion labor in a capitalist society must be segmented and controlled. The entire fact of commodity production is one loses their sovereignty and ability to produce what they desire and instead is forced into a megamachine that orients their labor. Labor in capitalist society is graded - man's projects can no longer exist by themselves but a vast system of credit grades them for profitability. The system lives on dead labor power - and demands a nonexistent sort of Platonic labor.

With every product we no longer see the human element within it - it is graded according to arbitrary standards that don't allow the expression of the laborer. His influence on all his products is occulted, instead the capitalist invents a totalizing megamachine - with its own rules that labor must follow. Consumer bodies judge everything to the standards of this nonexistent labor and estranged from their own labor power, unable produce anything of their own desire and [demand of the bourgeoisie to bring their sentiments to reality.](https://scholars-stage.org/the-title-ix-ifcation-of-american-childhood/)

With this insight perhaps Marx's quote makes a lot more sense.

>“For as soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.”

tldr never question marx plebs
