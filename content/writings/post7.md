To anyone who knows me its not a suprise who my favorite artist is. If you haven't guessed by the title already. Ready for some shilling? 

Hirasawa's music has been so impactful for me really because his entire project is satrical in a way. His music shares a lot of element with the hyperpop of East Asia - extravagant amounts of energy, catchy tunes, and they all have an insanely plastic feel. Even his early ones like ART MANIA, or Sunshine City - although to a lesser degree. In Big Brother we see Hirasawa at its finest - a melody of delusion that would put any K-POP producer to shame. Yet there is always a sense of urgency in Hirasawa's music, a sense of it all fleeting away. Unlike hyperpop the viewer is not captured into the spectacle - *the carnival is revealed* his illusions being shattered as the music goes faster and yet you keep dancing to it.

In some sense Hirasawa's music is revolutionary. It's not meant to sedate the viewer and bind him further. Instead Hirasawa's music is brutally revealing - it is quite literally the feeling of schizophernic accelerating late stage capitalism - moving into the void. Our dreamscapes come flashing before us, before being torn down by Hirasawa. In some sense its profoundly accelerationist.
