While much has been written about the abuses of tech firms, little in fact, has been written about the titanic shifts in information delivery that have occured over the last decade or so - perhaps longer. A relatively heteregenous publishing industry once dominated by [mid-sized entrants](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/penguin-random-house-simon-schuster-monster-about-amazon/617209/) has centralized, and the channels of discovery have signficantly narrowed. A public sphere has disappeared, replaced with narrow channels served by the internet. A society-wide canon disappears as divergent information streams slowly move away from each other.

Most mass web 2.0 sites online could be seen as a type of library, but with a completely different organization unto them. Whereas most libraries collate their information from an existing publishing industry and organize them in relatively standard ways - large web 2.0 farms can be seen as generating their own authorship and viewership. Both through intentional UI decisions and byzantine algorithms the user is effectively corraled into a certain stream. The aim here is not the development of literacy, but the development of a consumer. Is this not what American politics is increasingly becoming about?
