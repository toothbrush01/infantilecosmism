Briskly I walked into the fog. Faintly I could eye the outline of tall buildings - principlely from Osorra's Communist period. Forward, they stared at me with their monotonous yet colorful counterances - a memory of another time. Later as I walked forward into the limelight I came across an old playground. Three Keshite men were standing there discussing affairs. My phone rang.

> "Are you at the site?"

> "Yes"

> "Good, watch, do you recognize any of them?"

> "No"

> "That man, he's a major executive at a fish importing firm. You aren't high enough to know what yet - just keep watching"

> "Yes sir"

I stood nervously, were any eyes behind me. Who were these people anyways? I decided to hide in an abandoned building. This one was actually quite new, created during a housing bubble around 2005. Well now it was rubble, almost like it had survived a bombing run or something. I guess it did.
Could I hear them? No? Then why the fuck was I here. They shook hands and exchanged a briefcase - it was over.
