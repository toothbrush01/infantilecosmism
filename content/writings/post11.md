*Post I made on the WYDNA discord a while back*

Have any of you seen the recent thread about college radicalism? It got me thinking a bit about the publishing industry actually - in Imperial Russia or say Latin America or really most states pre internet you had networks of smaller publishing houses which couldn’t be fully controlled by the state. In the United States at least publishing is for the most part very centralized and smaller internet publications are mediated through larger social media platforms which algorithmically create subjects (KB had an interesting conceptualization where you effectively become an angel in their servers - and that is served according to their model). So whereas the flow of information previously has been more distributed and open - in the modern US it flows through channels that basically cooperate with the state and where groups are segmented and isolated to be served exactly what they subjectively desire

So I disagree a lot with his final conclusion that US campuses are depoliticized, but instead that segmentation that leads to distrust/fracturing so no real radical student unrest can emerge 

Although the point that activist culture is co-opted is totally correct. In one of my organizations I tried to do a thing where we’d rip books and upload them, but everyone would maintain distance from that except this one person because really it’s scary and subversive in a way in which clothing drives are not. Sad.

I feel like a lot of being an activist is basically just fetishizing the idea of being an activist and making a difference in modern America - but not actually getting your hands dirty and changing anything.
