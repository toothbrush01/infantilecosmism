I remember when I was 15... when I first drove into the city. It was breathtaking the city, a vast periphery of stone cobbled buildings flanking a small island of vast skyskrapers. Blue buildings rising up to the ether contained within them some of the largest companies in the country. Kakhab was perhaps the last place on the Avalonian frontier - a place where you could make it through mere will and hard work. Opportunity here was endless to whoever could look for it.

And that was inspiring to me. My hometown was quite close to Kakhab, barely an hour long drive away, but there was none of the lusture. The shipyards that made my hometown were languishing into nothingness. Vast concrete spires dominated the landscape - slowly crumbling and decaying. Graffiti littered the walls, addicts filled the dirt streets, there was nothing there but the rainforest that would soon slowly encroach us.

From the age of 15 onwards I convinced myself I would make it in Kakhab. I could leave my rotten hometown and go to a more proposerous, clean, and progressive place. But wouldn't my peers do the same? Stress would eat me away, especially as I sent the offers and nobody came knocking.

"Alyusha, [tbd] has looked at your resume and experience and we've decided to accept you for an interview. Please come to our office at 3pm on Thursday."

The email was just that. Short and concise. Strange for a startup. I hadn't really considered them as my first option but they were basically the only ones who responded in my job search, guess I didn't have a choice.

On the day of the interview I hopped on a train heading towards Kakhab. It was pretty old and dated, but it is all I could afford after rent for my falling apart apartment and instant ramen. The inside felt pretty tacky, red vinyl seats and a dated wallpaper from the 60s adorned the walls. The smell was strange, it smelt very old and strange. Anyways the doors closed and I slowly made it to Kakab.

This train would only make it to the outskirts of the city. To go further inwards I'd have to take the metro all the way to the glisening city center of the city. The slow train had let me in a bit later than I expected. I probably wouldn't have made it on time if it weren't for the fast and modern metro system.

The metro cars elicted a totally different aesthetic from the dingy train cars I was in earlier. Glass windows and ads took up most of the walls, the seats were made for accessibility purposes, and the train felt very clean and modern. Inside of the train various "AR stations" were placed, clearly demonstations from major technology companies. It was extremely quiet and made a calming effect on me.

From the station I ran towards the office as quick as I could. The interview was taking place very soon. Passerbyers watched as I tried to shove through them. Some even screamed at my clumzyness. Luckily I made it on time, completely exhasuted. 

The interview went fine, I passed most of the programming questions. The interviewer seemed to like me, in a way that at now I feel uneasy about.
