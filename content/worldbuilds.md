Hi ok, one of my biggest hobbies is doing worldbuilding. I was on II communities on NationStates before those communities fizziled out and a lot of the good worldbuilders left. I don't really work on my projects anymore that much but they are still semi-active. If you are interested in lore or anything fee free to DM me.
